# Ataxx-Game-Project
**An implementation of a two-person game played with red and blue pieces on a 7-by-7 board (language: Java)**

This project entails the creation of a digital version of the game Ataxx, played on a 7-by-7 board with red and blue pieces. Players take turns extending their pieces to adjacent empty squares or jumping to non-adjacent empty squares within a two-row and two-column distance. Opposing pieces adjacent to the destination square are converted to the player's color. The game begins with pieces in all four corners, and players alternate turns until no more moves are possible or until 25 consecutive jumps occur. Players can pass if they have no legal moves but at least one piece on the board. The winner is determined by the player with the most pieces at the game's end, with exceptions for automatic loss if a player has no pieces remaining or ties if specific conditions are met.
